# Bash functions to ease work on the U of Oklahoma  Supercomputer

The supercomputer uses the SLURM job queuing software. 
Some of the functions ease the use of this system.
Other functions ease doing boring tasks.

These functions can be adapted to run on local machines too!
The file paths will need editing.
The bash script calls two Python scripts in the subfolder.

May they inspire you to write new bash functions!
